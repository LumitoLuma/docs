## FAQ

<details>
  <summary><b>Is Program Overflow good for my computer?</b></summary>

  Well... I would not enable the dangerous features on a **real computer**, but if you do not enable them, I think the program is **safe**. However, I am not responsible of any damage this tool can make to your computer.

<details>
  <summary><b>I have seen that the image of this text document has features that the program I download through releases does not have. How can I get them?</b></summary>

  Currently are **under development**. You can always download the "latest latest" version of Program Overflow **through my downloads website**.
</details>
<details>
  <summary><b>How can I try this program safely?</b></summary>

  You can try it safely using a **virtual machine**. A good one (free) [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org), but the best (paid) is [VMware Workstation Pro](https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation-pro.html).
